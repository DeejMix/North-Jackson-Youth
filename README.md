# North-Jackson-Youth
 The aim of my North Jackson Youth Group website is to educate people about the youth group and encourage young people to be a part of youth group events. 
My client, Mr. Adam Carlucci, is my youth minister at North Jackson Church of Christ. I started the site before I talked to Mr. Adam; he liked the idea, so I went on building the site. 
The font I used is Arial, which came default from Bootstrap 4. Main title font is Indie Flower, provided by Google Fonts. 
On the main index.html file, I introduced the North Jackson Youth Group and provided a carousel with images of the youth group in action: All images are approved by parents to be on the site.
On the first subpage, is an embedded Google Map that shows the location of North Jackson, and can show directions to it. 
On the second subpage, there are some short paragraphs explaining the history of the North Jackson building. 
The third subpage is an information page, containing office hours, phone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses of the church. 
The fourth subpage is a FAQ, with frequent questions that are asked about the youth group. 
The final subpage is a gallery, that will be updated as new pictures are taken, and they are parent-approved to be put onto the site. Said photos are taken from the youth groupâ€™s official Facebook page; a link to it is provided by the footer icons.
